What China’s baby woes mean for its economic ambitions,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64897827,"['Crystal, who wished to withhold her real name, is a 26-year-old living in Beijing. Unlike most women from previous generations in China, she is unmarried and currently faces no pressure to tie the knot.', 'When asked why that is, she laughs: ""I think it\'s because my family members are either never married or divorced.""', ""It appears to be a common sentiment among young urban women in China. A 2021 survey by China's Communist Youth League of almost 3,000 people between the ages of 18 and 26, found that more than 40% of young women living in cities did not plan to marry - compared to less than 25% of men. This is in part due to rising childcare costs and the ghosts of China's one-child policy."", '""Having just one child or no children has become the social norm in China,"" says Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a prominent critic of the one-child policy.', '""The economy, social environment, education and almost everything else relates back to the one-child policy,"" he adds.', ""For Beijing, this is a worrying trend because China's population is declining. It's birth rate has been slowing for years but in 2022 its population fell for the first time in 60 years."", ""That's bad news for the world's second-largest economy, where the workforce is already shrinking and an ageing population is beginning to put pressure on the state's welfare services."", ""China's working age population - those between the ages of 16 and 59 - currently stands at about 875 million. They account for a little more than 60% of the country's people."", 'But the figure is expected to fall further, by another 35 million, over the next five years, according to an official estimate by the government in 2021.', '""China\'s demographic structure in 2018 was similar to that of Japan\'s in 1992,"" Mr Yi said. ""And China\'s [demographic structure] in 2040 will be similar to Japan\'s in 2020.""', ""Until last year, many economists had assumed China's growth would surpass that of the US by the end of the decade - a move which would cap the country's extraordinary economic ascent."", 'But Mr Yi says that is now looking unlikely, adding ""By 2031-2035, China will be doing worse than the US on all demographic metrics, and in terms of economic growth"".', ""The average age in China is now 38. But as its population ages and birth rates plummet further, there are concerns that China's workforce will eventually be unable to support those who have already retired."", 'The retirement age for men in China is 60 and for women, it is 55. Currently, those above 60 make up almost a fifth of the population. In Japan, which has one of the fastest ageing populations in the world, nearly a third of the people are 65 or older.', '""Population ageing is not unique to China but the strain on China\'s pension system is a lot more acute,"" says Louise Loo, a senior economist with Oxford Economics.', 'She says the number of retirees has already exceeded the number of contributors, leading to a drop in contributions to the pension fund since 2014.', ""The country's pension fund is administered at a provincial level and on a pay-as-you-work basis - that is, contributions from the workforce pay the retirees' pensions."", ""So Beijing, aware of these cracks in its system, created a fund in 2018 to shift pension pay-outs from richer provinces like Guangdong to those facing a deficit. But in 2019 a report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that because of its shrinking workforce, the country's main pension fund would be depleted by 2035."", 'Then in 2022 China launched its first private pension scheme in 36 cities, allowing individuals to open retirement accounts at banks to buy pension products like mutual funds.', ""But Ms Loo says it's unclear if many Chinese people, who typically invest savings in more traditional avenues such as property, would turn instead to private pension funds."", 'These problems are not unique to China - Japan and South Korea both have a greying population and a shrinking workforce.', 'Mr Yi noted that Beijing is poised to replicate Tokyo\'s policies to lower parenting costs but, he adds, ""China, which is \'getting old before it gets rich\' does not even have the financial resources to fully follow Japan\'s path.""', 'And this is not the only thing troubling Beijing. There\'s also a growing online youth movement to ""lie flat"". It calls on workers to reject the struggle for career success and promises release from the pressures of life and work in a fast-paced capitalist society. Add to the mix a high youth unemployment rate, which peaked last July when 20% of those aged between 15 and 24 were jobless.', 'As Mr Yi puts it: ""The labour force is the flour and the pension system is the skill of making bread. Without enough flour, it is impossible to make enough bread, even with the best bread-making skills.""']"

That is a theoretical possibility now, but unlikely, because it would mean the far-right, the left and much of the conservative opposition all coming together.', 'The dispute once again makes France look unreformable. By comparison with other countries in Europe, the change to the pension age is far from dramatic.', 'But the bill is regularly described by opponents as ""brutal"", ""inhuman"" and ""degrading"".', ""Morale in France is low and getting lower, and people see retirement as a bright spot in the future. But many feel that this is a rich man's government taking even that away.""]"

The diamond had to be tested twice to make sure that it was a lab-grown,"" he says.', 'Natural diamonds are formed at great heat and pressure deep underground and, since the 1950s, scientists have been trying to recreate that process above ground - resulting in two techniques.', 'The High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) system is where a diamond seed is surrounded by pure graphite (a type of carbon) and exposed to temperatures of about 1,500C and pressurised to approximately 1.5 million pounds per square inch in a chamber.', 'The second process is called Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) and involves putting the seed in a sealed chamber filled with carbon-rich gas and heating to around 800C. The gas sticks to the seed, building up a diamond atom by atom.', ""While those techniques emerged in the late 20th Century, it's only in the last 10 years that the process has been refined so that lab-grown diamonds can be made at the right price and quality to be sold as jewellery."", '""In the beginning, it was harder, because there were very few machines and very few scientists able to do it... over the last seven years, as more expertise became available in the market, we\'ve seen really big growth,"" says Olya Linde, a Zurich-based partner with Bain and Company\'s Natural Resources practice.', 'Ms Linde says that since the early 2000s the cost of producing lab-grown diamonds has halved every four years.', 'These days, a one carat diamond - a popular size and common in engagement rings - made in a lab would be around 20% cheaper than its naturally-formed equivalent.', 'Those falling costs have attracted entrepreneurs.', 'Snehal Dungarni is the chief executive of Bhanderi Lab Grown Diamonds, which he started in 2013.

South Korea was colonised by Japan from 1910 until the end of World War Two. Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of thousands of Koreans to work in its mines and factories. Women were pushed into sexual slavery.', 'These scars, while no longer fresh, are not forgotten nor forgiven here.', 'But last week, President Yoon dropped the demand that Japan compensate some of the victims of its slavery. He agreed South Korea would raise the money instead. In doing so he sought to put aside the past for the sake of the security of northeast Asia.', 'The opposition leader branded the deal the ""biggest humiliation in our history"".

Reports in the media, which is nearly all state-controlled, have said little about Ke Huy Quan or his background.', 'Some have stressed the actor\'s ethnic Chinese ancestry, rather than his Vietnamese origins. He was born in the southern Vietnamese capital Saigon in 1971, his family part of a commercially successful ethnic Chinese minority, of the kind seen in many South East Asian cities.

For a communist party which at the time had just defeated the military might of the United States, and has more recently presided over spectacular economic growth, it is an episode they would rather forget. Ke Huy Quan's Oscar is bringing it all back."", ""The tragic flight of the boat people is also a reminder of Vietnam's fraught relationship with its giant neighbour China. The two communist states were officially very close in their formative years after World War Two, with large quantities of Chinese assistance going to North Vietnam during its struggle against first the French, and then the Americans."", ""But by the time of the North Vietnamese victory in April 1975, and the reunification of the country, relations were increasingly strained. This happened as Vietnam's communist leadership sided with the Soviet Union over the Sino-Soviet split and the Chinese rapprochement with the US."", ""The large ethnic Chinese population, mainly in Cho Lon, including Ke Huy Quan's family, were caught up in this.

The prison mum experience Elizabeth Holmes is desperate to avoid,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64970156,"['On Friday, a US district judge will decide whether Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of medical testing company Theranos, can delay the start of her prison sentence while she appeals her conviction - in part due to her two young children. Her case points to what experts say is a blind spot in the prison system: the routine separation of new mothers from their babies.', 'Warning: This article contains language that some readers may find offensive', ""Last week, Angelica Zaragoza sat on a large black bus as it drove two hours south from Dallas to a women's prison in Gatesville, Texas. Ms Zaragoza, 44, was joined by a dozen young girls, all travelling to see their mothers."", 'Emotions were high, Ms Zaragoza said, a giddy excitement that lasted for the four-hour visit, arranged each month by the Dallas non-profit where she works. But when the time was up, their sadness set in.', '""We had a little girl, it was her first trip and when we went to leave she says: \'Why can\'t my mommy come with me?"" Ms Zaragoza said.', 'Years before, Ms Zaragoza had been the one left behind. She was 25 years old, starting an 18-month sentence in another Texas jail for drug offences. Soon after intake, she learned she was three months pregnant.', 'Until she reached her eighth month of pregnancy, Ms Zaragoza remained in a regular prison unit, sleeping in a colourless room with a rotating cast of cellmates. She was shuffled to and from health check-ups in shackles, she said, the weights on her hands and feet straining her swollen body. The shackles stayed on while she gave birth in a prison medical facility in Galveston, one leg and one arm bound to the hospital bed at all times.', ""Afterwards, she was given 15 minutes to hold her infant daughter, named Jalyssa, before they were separated. They would not meet again until her release. Ms Zaragoza's aunt, who agreed to take care of Jalyssa, said the three-hour drive to the prison was too long and too expensive to bring the baby."", '""It takes a toll on a mother,"" Ms Zaragoza said. ""A mother loses her kids, she loses her hope.""', ""As the United States' prison population has climbed, the number of incarcerated women has surged. In the last two decades the number of women in lock up has grown more than 700% - double the rate of men. The majority are mothers, many single mothers and the sole caregivers of young children. They include an estimated 58,000 pregnant women who enter jails and prisons each year."", 'But experts say pregnant prisoners and women who have recently given birth remain a blind spot in a prison system designed for men.', '""With the exploding [prison] population, you had an unprecedented number of women also entering,"" said Jill Morrison, a law professor at Georgetown. ""But the system was not ready to accommodate them. I don\'t think the system had any real interest in accommodating them.""', 'In the US, incarcerated people have a constitutional right to healthcare. But there are no mandatory health guidelines, and no national standards for pregnant or postpartum prisoners.', '""There\'s no standardisation and there is so much variability,"" said Dr Carolyn Sufrin, a gynaecologist and obstetrician, who leads the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics Project at Johns Hopkins University. ""Every prison and jail kind of does its own thing.""', 'In some places, conditions have improved since Ms Zaragoza gave birth to her daughter in 2003. Twenty-two states, including Texas, now prohibit the shackling of women during active labour and delivery in most circumstances. Federal prisons have a similar ban.', 'And a quarter of US states, including California, Illinois and New York, have state prisons with mother-baby units - essentially nurseries where babies can stay with or near their mothers for as long as 18 months, a more common practice in countries like the UK and Canada.', 'But the vast majority of American prisoners do not have this option. The US remains one of four countries that routinely separates mothers from their newborns, a list that also includes the Bahamas, Liberia and Suriname.', '""In most cases, women are separated soon after birth,"" said Dr Sufrin. Some women will be allowed to stay with their baby in hospital for up to three days after delivery. But many will be rushed back to jail ""as soon as possible"", she said.', ""The vast majority of fathers in prison report that their child's mother is the primary caregiver. But for women behind bars, almost half of whom are single mothers, their child is more likely to be sent to live with a grandparent."", ""From there, visits are rare and dependent on both the institution's particular rules and the child's caregiver - how often they can make what is often a lengthy and expensive trip. Many mothers will not have any in-person visits with their children at all."", '""It\'s not like these visits aren\'t happening because the parents don\'t want to see their children or their guardians don\'t want them connected,"" said Brittany Barnett, founder of the non-profit Girls Embracing Mothers (Gem), where Ms Zaragoza now works. ""It\'s just the distance and the cost. People cannot afford to take off the whole day of work to make that trip.""', ""Ms Barnett's own mother was incarcerated when she was 22 years old.

She leaned her forehead against the glass and saw an imprint of a tiny set of lips."", '""It just told me some other younger child had tried to reach their own mother before me,"" Ms Barnett said. ""Even as a young adult, my mother\'s incarceration was emotionally, physically, and materially devastating… So how could a child possibly bear this weight?""', 'The visits were a ""survival line"", Ms Barnett said, inspiring her to create Gem 10 years ago. The organisation now provides monthly four-hour visits for 25 girls and their mothers in Texas prisons.', 'Ms Zaragoza did not find the programme herself until her third and final jail term - two years, for failing to pay her probation fees. By then her daughter was 10, she said, old enough to understand and old enough to blame her mother for going away.', '""The first couple of visits were hard. She wouldn\'t speak to me,"" Ms Zaragoza said. But a few months in, Jalyssa began to warm to her mother again.', '""She opened the door a little bit and we grew from there,"" Ms Zaragoza said.', 'In the case of Elizabeth Holmes, who has not disclosed the age of her second child, experts said her fate will rest on the discretion of the judge.', '""Defendants are sometimes granted a delay for reporting to prison to deal with medical issues, so it is possible that this request will be granted,"" said Barbara McQuade, a former US attorney, in an email to the BBC.', ""But many said that an exception or delay to her more than 11-year sentence would mark a significant break from the norm, one that may be linked to Holmes' relative celebrity and privilege."", 'Inmates in the US are disproportionately people of colour and poor.

The men have spent months facing both regular Russian army forces, and prisoners recruited by the Wagner private military group who have swarmed their trenches in droves. Troops say Russian casualties far outweigh theirs, but the enemy is deploying new techniques to try to seize the city and surrounding countryside."", ""Ukraine's forces are outgunned and outnumbered, but on a chalk hillside to the south, there is the anti-tank group from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. 3Storm - as they are known - are unyielding. They've dug trenches deep into the earth. Timber props supporting the roof shudder as Russian artillery lands in the near distance, and field mice scurry along duck boards. An antiquated field telephone sits in a wooden nook; these are conditions their grandfathers would recognise."", '""They cannot get to us, we can see for a kilometre in all directions,"" says a bearded 26-year-old soldier who goes by the call sign ""Dwarf"", pointing out Russian positions. ""We can hit the enemy with everything we have,"" he says.', 'Neither the Russian nor Ukrainian armies release official casualty figures for Bakhmut, or elsewhere, but the mostly abandoned city has become a slaughter house.', 'In a week fighting for the city, Dwarf\'s company faced conscripted prisoners from Russia\'s Wagner group.

""The [Russian vehicle] arrives, 50 bodies come out, a day passes, 50 bodies come out again,"" he says. His company lost a fraction of that number, he says.', 'Officially, Ukraine estimates that for every one of its soldiers killed, Russia loses seven. Earlier this week, Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members in a 24-hour period in the battle for Bakhmut. None of these numbers can be independently verified.', 'In a newspaper interview, two captured Wagner conscripts told the Wall Street Journal that before they are sent forward, they receive little training beyond learning to crawl through forests in the dark. After six months serving at the front they are freed - assuming they survive.', ""Conditions all along the 600-mile-long eastern front have begun to change. 3Storm's chalky hilltop hideout feels like dry land compared with the surrounding territory. An early spring has turned the hard ground of winter to mud porridge - which may favour the defenders.

A battlefield ambulance speeds by unsteadily, its caterpillar tracks ploughing up the ground, and spraying pools of sludge as it struggles for grip."", 'The villages around here - the location can\'t be revealed - are in ruin. Handwritten signs on gates, mostly in Russian, announce ""People Live Here"", a plea as much as it is a statement.

Ukrainians are dying there, too, in ever increasing numbers.', 'On the hillside, a group of soldiers have gathered around a gun position, and I ask Dwarf - given that Ukraine is losing soldiers to untrained Russian convicts - if the defence of dead city, surrounded by the enemy, makes sense.', 'He says, ""I was wondering, myself, if we should keep defending Bakhmut. On the one hand what\'s happening here now is awful. There are no words to describe it. But the alternative is we give up Bakhmut and move to another settlement. What\'s the difference between defending Bakhmut or any other village?""', 'His comrade, a strongly built man with a full dark beard who goes by the call sign Holm, agrees.

This has led to a huge surplus of the onion crop in March, which would otherwise have hit the market in December-January,"" Mr Kuwalekar says, adding that things will get worse when the winter harvest also reaches the market in a few weeks.', 'Farmers in Nashik say they are only getting around 200-400 rupees ($2.43-$4.85; £2-£4) per 100kg of onions in the wholesale market.', 'Ajit Navale, a farmer leader from Maharashtra, explains the economics of onion farming.', 'Onion prices, he says, need to stay above 1,200 rupees per 100 kg if the farmer is to make at least 400 rupees of profit.', ""While wholesale prices are low, retail prices haven't been affected much. Mr Navale says that only middlemen and traders benefit from the supply glut."", '""They buy onions from farmers at a very cheap rate and sell them in cities for higher prices. Ultimately, both farmers and consumers are affected,"" he says, adding that it\'s ""unfortunate"" that the government isn\'t intervening.', ""It's a complaint shared by others. Mr Kuwalekar points out that even though demand for onions is steady, India doesn't have a proper policy to regulate prices. When prices rise, the government often bans exports, fearing protests at home."", '""Sometimes we even have to back out of supply commitments to other countries, which makes us lose our credibility,"" he says.', ""Farmers who eke out a living from one crop season to another say that these policy decisions don't mean much to them."", '""I was supposed to arrange my daughter\'s wedding this year and also construct a house. That\'s unlikely now. My creditors are demanding money,"" says Dagu Khote, who borrowed money to plant onions.', '""I will now look for work as a daily wage labourer until the monsoon starts,"" he says.', 'BBC News India is now on YouTube.

The doctors selling bogus treatments to people facing blindness,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64838936,"['Doctors around the world are offering false hope and bogus treatments to millions of people with an incurable condition that can lead to blindness. BBC reporter Ramadan Younes, who has the disease himself, went undercover to expose them.', 'Lying in hospital for five days in complete darkness, bandages covering my eyes, I imagined what my life would be like with my vision improved.', ""It was 2013, and I had travelled to Beijing, China, after reading about a treatment for the genetic eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Six years earlier, I had been diagnosed with the condition, which means I'm gradually losing my vision and one day I could go blind."", 'I raised $13,000 (£10,900) to pay for treatment that I was told could make my eyesight better and stop it deteriorating further. I was told it would change my life.', ""When I returned to my home in Cairo, Egypt, I told friends and family that my sight was improving - but it wasn't true. Nothing had changed."", 'Month after month, I still feel my vision fading away. The condition means the millions of light sensitive cells at the back of my eye are gradually dying.', ""There is currently no cure - just one approved genetic therapy that can stop the disease progressing, but only for some patients with a specific faulty gene. But it hasn't stopped doctors around the world from claiming they can treat the untreatable, often at huge expense."", 'In three years of investigating supposed treatments for RP, I spoke to dozens of patients like me who had been given false hope, and I met many doctors claiming to have miraculous therapies - in places as varied as Miami, USA, Russia and Gaza.', 'In Gaza I met people living in refugee camps who had gathered thousands of dollars from friends and family to be treated with injections of glucose and vitamins, along with vibrating massage devices.', 'I met patients in Sudan who were urged by doctors to travel to Russia every year and spend thousands of dollars on vitamin injections - which even a member of staff at the hospital admitted to me over the phone could not possibly work.', 'But the case of Miami\'s Dr Jeffrey Weiss - who says in his promotional videos, ""I am treating the untreatable. I am treating people who have never had hope"" - was the most disturbing, taking place in one of the most highly regulated healthcare systems in the world.', 'The treatment is actually a clinical trial run by Dr Weiss, who performs the operation, and his colleague Dr Steven Levy, who is chair of the study and who has the initial discussions with patients.', 'But unlike most trials in the US, which are funded by the government or private drug and medical device companies, in this case patients have to pay $20,000 (£16,750) to take part.', 'One leading doctor - president of the American Society of Retina Specialists, Dr Judy Kim - told the BBC charging for a clinical trial went against widely accepted ethical guidelines and was ""morally reprehensible"".', ""I called Dr Levy, posing as a patient and secretly recording him, to see what he tells patients about the trial. He told me that it involved taking stem cells from the patient's bone marrow and then injecting them under the eyelids and into the back of the eye sockets."", 'He told me that Dr Weiss had treated about 700 patients with ""no complications"", and ""the vast majority"" of patients experienced benefits.', 'But former patients told me a different story. One, named Ahmed Farouki, said that after the procedure he found he could no longer see with his left eye.', 'Since then, Mr Farouki said he has been telling his story on social media and warning others not to have the treatment. He said if he could speak to Dr Weiss, he would tell him: ""Stop sabotaging people\'s futures. Enough is enough.""', 'Several other patients also told me they experienced complications after the procedure, including having debris in the eye.', 'All the patients I spoke to in the United States found the treatment the same way: through a government website called Clinicaltrials.gov.', 'Blind Faith', 'Exposing the doctors selling bogus eye treatments', 'Watch on BBC iPlayer', 'It lists more than 400,000 trials and, in most cases, there is no way to tell what is regulated, and what is not.', 'A short disclaimer tells users that ""listing a study on this site does not mean it\'s been evaluated by the US federal government"".', 'So patients searching for a glimmer of hope are left with little guidance as to whether they are joining a valid trial or not.', 'I struggled to believe that a doctor could operate so openly unless there was some scientific evidence behind his claims. So I played recordings of my call with Dr Levy to three professors of ophthalmology.', 'Dr Byron Lam from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami described Dr Levy\'s claims as ""really crazy"" and said he did not believe there was ""any scientific validity"" to the idea that injecting bone marrow stem cells would help the condition.', 'Responding to claims that there were ""zero adverse events"" from the procedure, Dr Thomas Albini - also from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute - said it was ""extremely difficult for me to believe"".', '""There are risks to anaesthesia, there are risks to the bone marrow biopsy and there are certainly risks to the eye procedure,"" he said.', 'Prof Robert MacLaren from the University of Oxford said: ""This is not a valid clinical trial. This is a very worrying treatment that\'s potentially damaging for the patients and it needs to stop.""', 'After I revealed to Dr Levy I was a journalist investigating this treatment and requested an interview with Dr Weiss, he wrote back and said I was a sham.', '""Your self-serving desire for a tiny flicker of fame through harming our study, remains unbound.', '""You are a disgrace to your family, and to millions of people suffering from untreatable eye disease from across the world.', '""Best regards, Steven Levy, MD.""', ""I wondered how all of this was possible in a highly regulated country such as the US, especially as there is evidence of concerns about the two doctors' methods."", 'In 2021, the American Academy of Ophthalmology permanently terminated the membership of Dr Weiss after investigating the way the trial was run.', 'It concluded that the study broke rules against giving ""false, untrue, deceptive, or misleading information"" to the public and creating ""unjustified expectations of results"". The academy also judged that it breached the rules with results that did not ""substantiate the publicly made claims for safety and efficacy of the research"".', ""Dr Levy had surrendered his licence to practise medicine in 2004 in Connecticut and New York. In New York, the state's Department of Health had charged him with 41 specifications of professional misconduct - including gross negligence, incompetence on more than one occasion, fraudulent practice and failing to comply with a federal law. Dr Levy did not contest the allegations."", 'But Andrew Yaffa, a medical malpractice lawyer, told me it was hard to stop the two doctors from offering their treatment in Florida.', 'Mr Yaffa said more than 15 patients had approached him with potential cases, but he said medical malpractice in the state is complex and expensive to pursue.', ""Because the patients' vision was already badly deteriorated by their illness, it would be hard to get sufficient damages awarded by a court to fund the expense of litigation, he said."", '""Florida requires that your hired hand that you bring to your house to cut your lawn has more insurance than any physician that\'s going to operate on you,"" he said.', ""The US Food and Drug Administration regulates clinical trials and it seemed Dr Levy's conversation with me might have broken the rules on how they should be run. But Mr Yaffa said the agency was understaffed and the regulations needed more clarity."", 'The FDA did not respond to specific questions about Dr Levy and Dr Weiss.', 'But in a statement, the agency said companies making unsubstantiated claims about unproven cell therapies were doing ""a disservice to those innovators who are working to develop safe and effective stem cell products"".', 'The FDA added that unproven and unapproved stem cell therapies can be ""particularly unsafe and have led to serious infections, blindness, and death"".']"
Aukus submarine deal: Is conflict with China getting closer?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-64959500,"[""China has reacted with predictable anger to this week's official announcement of the so-called Aukus pact."", 'The details, unveiled on Monday in San Diego, bind together Australia, the UK and the US in a far-reaching defence and security alliance aimed at confronting Chinese military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.', '""Going down a dangerous road"", ""disregarding the concerns of the international community"" and even ""risking a new arms race and nuclear proliferation"" are just some of the accusations being levelled by Beijing at this trio of western allies.', 'Not since the US Congressional leader Nancy Pelosi made her controversial visit to Taiwan last summer has China expressed such intense disapproval of Western actions.', 'China, the world\'s most populous nation, with the world\'s largest army and navy, says it is starting to feel ""penned in"" by the US and its allies in the western Pacific. In response, President Xi Jinping announced recently that China would accelerate the expansion of its defence spending and named national security as the primary concern of the coming years.', 'Little wonder then that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke this week about a dangerous decade ahead and the need to gear up to meet the growing security challenges.', 'So how did we get to this point and is the world drawing closer to a catastrophic conflict in the Pacific between China and the US and its allies?', 'The West got it wrong on China. For years there was a naïve assumption in foreign ministries that China\'s economic liberalisation would inevitably lead to an opening up of society and greater political freedom. As western multinational companies set up joint ventures and hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens began to enjoy a higher standard of living then surely, the reasoning went, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would loosen its grip on the population, allow some modest democratic reforms and become a fully-fledged member of the so-called ""rules-based international order"".', ""But it hasn't worked out that way."", 'Yes, China has become an economic giant, a vital, integral part of the global supply chain and the most important trading partner for countries all over the world. But instead of coupling this with a shift towards democracy and liberalisation, Beijing has embarked on a course that has alarmed both Western governments and many of its neighbours like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.', 'Such as? The list is long but here are the main bones of contention between China and the West:', ""Militarily, China today is a force to be reckoned with. In recent years its People's Liberation Army has made enormous strides in technology and innovation as well as numbers. China's Dong Feng hypersonic missiles, for example, can travel at speeds in excess of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), armed with either a high explosive or nuclear warhead. This is giving the US Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, pause for thought as to just how close it is prepared to risk sailing to China's massed missile batteries onshore."", 'On nuclear ballistic missiles too, China has embarked on a programme of rapid expansion, aiming to treble its number of warheads as it builds new silos out in remote western regions.', ""None of this though, means that China wants to go to war. It doesn't. When it comes to Taiwan, it would much prefer to exert enough pressure on it that it capitulates and submits to Beijing's rule without a shot being fired. On Hong Kong, the Uyghurs and intellectual property it knows that over time the criticism will die down because trade with China is simply too important for the rest of the world."", ""So although tensions are high right now, and there could well be flashpoints still to come, both sides - China and the West - know that a war in the Pacific would be catastrophic for everyone and despite the angry rhetoric, it is in absolutely no-one's interests.""]"
